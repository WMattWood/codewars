# codewars
These are solutions to codewars katas which I have solved on codewars.
Additionally, this repo serves as a learning ground for implementing tests.
The testing is performed using `jest` and `chai` on the JavaScript side.
Only katas of 5kyu difficulty and up have been included.

**JAVASCRIPT**

To run tests from inside the 'js' folder run:

```$ yarn test```

Or if you wish to run tests for a specific kata you can run:

```$ yarn test <kataFileName>```
