# codewars
these are solutions to codewars katas which I have solved on codewars.
additionally, this repo serves as a learning ground for implementing tests.
the testing is performed using `jest` and `chai` on the JavaScript side.
only katas of 5kyu difficulty and up have been included.

To run the tests

**JAVASCRIPT**
from inside the `js` folder run 
```$ yarn test```
if you wish to run tests for a specific kata you can run
```$ yarn test <kataFileName>```

**RUBY**
under construction
